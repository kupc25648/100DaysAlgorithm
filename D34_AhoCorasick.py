'''
Aho-Corasick is a string searching algorithm running in linear time and my heart would be broken if I missed this one in the series.
I already spent a day on string searching, so whatâ€™s the difference to day 29? Aho-Corasick uses a finite state automaton to search for a whole set of patterns at once while holding linearity condition regardless of the set size.
There are two parts you have to implement, FSA construction and searching. I definitely recommend to study the FSA construction through. Years ago I attended a competition and adaptation of Aho-Corasick with carefully designed FSA proved to be many times faster than any other solution and helped me to win.
