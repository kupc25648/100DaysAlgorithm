Convex hull is a way to capture a set of points using another set of points that is preferable. In this case a continuous set that is convex and minimal, since convex and minimal is a property thatâ€™s always good to have.

There are many algorithms to find convex hull, but I like particularly this one.

Choose left-most point U and right-most point V. Both U and V reside on hull and UV forms a line that splits the set. On each side of UV choose the furthest point P, throw away all points inside triangle UVP and proceed recursively on UP and VP.

    # return points on left side of UV
    return [p for p in points if np.cross(p-u, v-u)<0]

def extend(u, v, points):
    if not points:
        return []

    # find furthest point W and split search to WV, UW
    w = min(points, key = lambda p: np.cross(p-u, v-u))
    p1,p2 = split(w,v,points), split(u,w, points)
    return extend(w, v, p1) + [w] + extend(u, w, p2)

    # find two hull points , U ,V and split  to left and rigth search
    u = min(points, key = lambda p :p[0])
    v = max(points, key = lambda p :p[0])
    left, right = split(u,v,points) , split(v,u,points)

           [u] + extend(v,u, right) + [v]
