'''
Hopfield net is a kind of neural network with binary threshold units and recurrent connections. The connections are symmetric and the model has a global energy function which results in a surprisingly simple training algorithm.
Iâ€™m not going to dive deep into Hopfield nets. Instead, let me show a little intuition using a small example.
This model was pre-trained to store a memory 011. We set its units to values 110 and will track the energy function.

E = -(-1*1*1 + -1*1*0 + 1*1*0) = 1
If two units are active, the weight of their connection is subtracted from the global energy.

E = -(-1*1*0 + -1*0*0 + 1*1*0) = 0
After flipping the top unit, global energy decreased which is a good thing.

E = -(-1*1*0 + -1*1*0 + 1*1*1) = -1
After another flipping of the bottom right unit, energy decreased, again. The system is at its global energy minimum. This minimum represents a previously stored memory 011.
Hopfield net is able to reconstruct a full information from a portion of it. If you look at the examples below, three memories are stored into Hopfield net. These vectors are later fully reconstructed from just a few bits.
