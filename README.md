# 100DaysAlgorithms

Since I have not really trained as a programmer, I have study 100daysalgorithms from  
https://medium.com/100-days-of-algorithms by Tomáš Bouda (please check his medium).
Most code are similar to original ones, but it allowed me to learn many concept in programming.  
I did skip some codes that seem total unrelated to my fields (architecture, engineering, machine learning).  
However, I leave blank codes, in case I have to come back for them.
